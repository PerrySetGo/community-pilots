    <h1>Expectations Agreement</h1>
    <h2>Things we need to agree on</h2>
    <p>As a Pilot, you are representing Netlify in a semi-official capacity.<br>
     You should feel encouraged to be yourself! But at the same time, it's important we agree that, as long as you are a Pilot, you will:
    <ul>
     <li>Not use language or engage in actions that can be construed as racist, sexist, homo or transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory.<b>Forums members should never feel unwelcome because of their background.</b></li>
     <li>Not make any statements that are disparaging or damaging to Netlify or the Jamstack in general. <b>Healthy debate and a diversity of opinions is encouraged, but please keep your wording neutral.</b> </li>
     <li>Not use your elevated status to insinuate or act as if you are a paid Netlify employee or otherwise achieve financial gain. </li>
     <li>Not use your status as a Pilot to stalk, harass, or otherwise violate the personal boundaries of anyone in the forums.</li>
     <li>To respect the authority of Netlify staff, who have the final say in running the forums and communicating with customers. </li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>
    If someone's experience in the forums is negatively impacted by something you say or do, and they bring it to our attention, we'll chat with you about what went wrong.<br>
    If a Netlify staff member sees you saying or doing something inappropriate, we'll also chat with you about it and aim towards a resolution.<br>
    If it's a serious violation, we may revoke your Pilot status at any time. If your Netlify account has been upgraded, these upgrades will also be revoked without warning should a serious violation occur.<br>
    Even if you are a Pilot, the general Terms of Service and Code of Conduct do still apply.<br>
