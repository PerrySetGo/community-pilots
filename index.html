        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Welcome to the Netlify Community Pilots!</h2>
        <p>We're so glad you are here - and we are so glad to have you on board. If you are seeing this page, you have been identified as someone who is:
          <ul>
              <li>knowledgeable about Netlify products and the Jamstack in general</li>
              <li>responsible, trustworthy and reliable</li>
              <li>a strong communicator of both technical and non-technical concepts</li>
              </br>
              and above everything:
              </br></br>
              <li>excited to contribute, help people, and foster learning & growth in others, regardless of their background.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Why does this program exist?</h2>
        We believe that community is co-created - not just us, but also by you!
        </br></br>
        When we launched our Netlify Support Community, we realized right away that there were awesome,
        talented people who knew a lot and were excited to help out in our forums. And so the idea to formalize this program was born!
        </p>
        <h2>What do the Community Pilots work on?</h2>
        <p>Community Pilots are an important part of the Community forums. They:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help new members feel welcome and accepted</li>
            <li>Partner with Support Engineers debug issues and solve problems</li>
            <li>Assist us in dealing with Code of Conduct violations and unwanted spam</li>
            <li>...and assist people in their learning!</li>
        </ul>

        Community Pilots are folks who we have identified as trustworthy and reliable - and so they get extra capabilities in Community similar to Support Engineers.

        <h2>What kinds of contributions are we expecting?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Asking clarifying questions - making sure we have all the info we need to help</li>
            <li>Pointing people to existing Support Guides</li>
            <li>Suggesting resources for learning: Blog posts, guides, tutorials, tools</li>
            <li>Actively Debugging! Many problems are easily fixed with a second set of ðŸ‘€</li>
            <li>Tagging and editing posts so Community stays easy to use</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What kinds of rewards are there?</h2>
        <p>Great question! We're so appreciative of contributions to our forums. Community Pilots receive: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A special title and user status in Community</li>
            <li>Elevated powers in Community</li>
            <li>Special swag only for Community Pilots</li>
            <li>Exclusive access to betas and early releases</li>
            <li>A close partnership with the Netlify team, especially the Support team</li>
            <li>Upgraded Netlify accounts with free paid features</li>
            <li>Unlimited, thanks, kudos, respect, gratitude and admiration from Netlify customers worldwide!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Will I get some training on how this works?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you will absolutely get guidance! We have tips on how to find questions to answer, where to find
          information that helps people, and how to make sure you are making people feel included and welcomed.<br><br>
          The latter is very important: We don't believe an inclusive and successful community just "happens". <br><br>
          Historically, forums such as StackOverflow and others have not been welcoming to women & gender minorities, people of colour, folks without computer science degrees, and people new to tech.<br><br>
          We want our forums to be different: Inclusive, supportive, friendly, welcoming.<br>
          We believe that we need to actively create this space - having a forum where people are too intimidated to ask "stupid" questions helps nobody! We need you to help make this space the best it can be.
        </p>
        <h2>I'm fairly new (to tech, to Netlify, to webdevelopment). Can I still help?</h2>
        <p>Yes! Being fairly new is no barrier. In fact, we think it's likely you'll be able to empathize with the kinds of mistakes many of our new customers face!
          You don't have years of experience to join the program: Wanting to learn, grow, and help people is enough.</p>

          <h2>Is there a specific time commitment?</h2>
          <p> Not at present. We hope you'll be active regularly. We'd like to see you contribute every week if you can, some Community Pilots are active daily, but we realize that people have competing priorities. <br>
             You can let us know what we can expect from you.
            If your availability changes, let us know. If we see you drop off, or go silent, we'll try and check in with you about it. We may downgrade your accounts if you become inactive.
          </p>
