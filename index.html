        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h2>Welcome!</h2>
        <p>Thanks for your interest in the Netlify Pilots!
          <b>Pilots...</b>
          <ul>
              <li>...are knowledgeable about Netlify products and the Jamstack in general</li>
              <li>...are responsible, trustworthy and reliable</li>
              <li>...are strong communicators of both technical and non-technical concepts</li>
              </br>
              and above everything:
              </br></br>
              <li>are excited to contribute, help people, and foster learning & growth in others, regardless of their background.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Why does this program exist?</h2>
        We believe that community is co-created - not just us, but also by you!
        </br></br>
        When we launched the Netlify Support Forums, we realized right away that there were awesome,
        talented people who knew a lot and were excited to help out in our forums. And so the idea to formalize this program was born!
        </p>
        <h2>What do the Pilots work on?</h2>
        <p>Pilots are an important part of the Support forums. They:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Help new members feel welcome and accepted</li>
            <li>Partner with Support Engineers debug issues and solve problems</li>
            <li>Assist us in dealing with Code of Conduct violations and unwanted spam</li>
            <li>...and assist people in their learning!</li>
        </ul>

        Pilots are folks who we have identified as trustworthy and reliable - and so they get extra capabilities in the Forums similar to Support Engineers.

        <h2>What kinds of contributions are we expecting?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Asking clarifying questions - making sure we have all the info we need to help</li>
            <li>Pointing people to existing Support Guides</li>
            <li>Suggesting resources for learning: Blog posts, guides, tutorials, tools</li>
            <li>Actively Debugging! Many problems are easily fixed with a second set of ðŸ‘€</li>
            <li>Tagging and editing posts so the Forums stay easy to use</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What kinds of rewards are there?</h2>
        <p>Great question! We're so appreciative of contributions to our forums. Pilots receive: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A special title and user status in the Forums</li>
            <li>Elevated powers in the Forums</li>
            <li>Special swag only for Pilots</li>
            <li>Exclusive access to betas and early releases</li>
            <li>A close partnership with the Netlify team, especially the Support team</li>
            <li>Upgraded Netlify accounts with free paid features</li>
            <li>Unlimited, thanks, kudos, respect, gratitude and admiration from Netlify customers worldwide!</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Will I get some training on how this works?</h2>
        <p>Yes, you will absolutely get guidance! We have tips on how to find questions to answer, where to find
          information that helps people, and how to make sure you are making people feel included and welcomed.<br><br>
          The latter is very important: We don't believe an inclusive and successful community just "happens". <br><br>
          Historically, forums such as StackOverflow and others have not been welcoming to women & gender minorities, people of colour, folks without computer science degrees, and people new to tech.<br><br>
          We want our forums to be different: Inclusive, supportive, friendly, welcoming.<br>
          We believe that we need to actively create this space - having a forum where people are too intimidated to ask "stupid" questions helps nobody! We need you to help make this space the best it can be.
        </p>
        <h2>I'm fairly new (to tech, to Netlify, to webdevelopment). Can I still help?</h2>
        <p>Yes! Being fairly new is no barrier. In fact, we think it's likely you'll be able to empathize with the kinds of mistakes many of our new customers face!
          You don't have years of experience to join the program: Wanting to learn, grow, and help people is enough.</p>

          <h2>Is there a specific time commitment?</h2>
          <p> Not at present. We hope you'll be active regularly. We'd like to see you contribute every week if you can, some Pilots are active daily, but we realize that people have competing priorities. <br>
             You can let us know what we can expect from you.
            If your availability changes, let us know. If we see you drop off, or go silent, we'll try and check in with you about it. We may downgrade your accounts if you become inactive.
          </p>

          <h2>Things we need to agree on</h2>
          <p>As a Pilot, you are representing Netlify in a semi-official capacity.<br>
            You should feel encouraged to be yourself! But at the same time, it's important we agree that, as long as you are a Pilot, you will:
          <ul>
            <li>Not use language or engage in actions that can be construed as racist, sexist, homo or transphobic, or otherwise discriminatory.<b>Forums members should never feel unwelcome because of their background.</b></li>
            <li>Not make any statements that are disparaging or damaging to Netlify or the Jamstack in general. <b>Healthy debate and a diversity of opinions is encouraged, but please keep your wording neutral.</b> </li>
            <li>Not use your elevated Forums status to insinuate or act as if you are a paid Netlify employee or otherwise achieve financial gain. </li>
            <li>Not use your status as a Pilot to stalk, harass, or otherwise violate the personal boundaries of anyone in the Forums.</li>
            <li>To respect the authority of Netlify staff, who have the final say in running the forums and communicating with customers. </li>
          </ul>
          <br><br>
          If someone's experience in the forums is negatively impacted by something you say or do, and they bring it to our attention, we'll chat with you about what went wrong.<br>
          If a Netlify staff member sees you saying or doing something inappropriate, we'll also chat with you about it and aim towards a resolution.<br>
          If it's a serious violation, we may revoke your Pilot status at any time. If your Netlify account has been upgraded, these upgrades will also be revoked without warning should a serious violation occur.<br>
          Even if you are a Pilot, the general <a href="https://forums-docs.netlify.com/terms-of-service.html">Terms of Service</a> and <a href="https://forums-docs.netlify.com/code-of-conduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> do still apply.<br>

          <h2>Interested? Hooray.</h2>
          <p>Great. We'd love to have you join us. <br>
